            <p>In communications and information processing, code is a system of rules to convert information—such as a
                letter, word, sound, image, or gesture—into another form, sometimes shortened or secret, for
                communication
                through a communication channel or storage in a storage medium. An early example is the invention of
                language, which enabled a person, through speech, to communicate what they thought, saw, heard or felt
                to
                others. But speech limits the range of communication to the distance a voice can carry, and limits the
                audience to those present when the speech is uttered . The invention of writing, which converted spoken
                language into visual symbols, extended the range of communication across space and time. The process of
                encoding converts information from a source into symbols for communication or storage. Decoding is the
                reverse process, converting code symbols back into a form that the recipient understands, such as
                English
                or/and Spanish. One reason for coding is to enable communication in places where ordinary plain
                language,
                spoken or written, is difficult or impossible. For example, semaphore, where the configuration of flags
                held
                by a signaler or the arms of a semaphore tower encodes parts of the message, typically individual
                letters
                and numbers. Another person standing a great distance away can interpret the flags and reproduce the
                words
                sent.
